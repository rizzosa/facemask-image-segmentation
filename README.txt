This repository contains code that uses FasterRCNN image segmentation of people wearing facemasks. The images themselves can be found in the images folder and their annotations are found in the annotations folder stored in .xml format. 
We train the pretrained fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn model from torchvision on our data. The model state_dict is saved as model.pt.
